This is the scene-file setting for the attached script we want to test. Although many updates (layout, material, culling) can occur automatically, we manually invoke public parameterless methods to ensure coverage. Note: This UI component includes UnityEvent (m_OnCullStateChanged) and supports direct invocation of safe public no-arg methods.",
