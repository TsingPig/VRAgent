Serialized settings in scene: nextSceneName='VisualizationPC', timeDuration=4.25. Start() automatically schedules StartGame() via Invoke after timeDuration to load the next scene. No Rigidbody/Collider/EventTrigger components are specified on this GameObject, and the script exposes no public no-arg methods; thus no direct manual Trigger is applicable. This unit waits for the automatic event to occur and verifies the scene transition.",
